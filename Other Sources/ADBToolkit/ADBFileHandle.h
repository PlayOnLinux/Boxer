//ADBFileHandle describes an NSFileHandle-like interface for reading and writing
//data to and from files and file-like resources (i.e. byte streams that allow
//random access). It differs from NSFileHandle in that it can provide a FILE * handle
//for use with stdlib IO functions.

//This library also defines general protocols for describing handles that implement
//one or more aspects of the same API.
